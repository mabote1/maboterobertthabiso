                <h2>Undergraduate Academic Engagement!</h2>
                <p>This January, I was selected to travel to Accra, Ghana with Dr. Hall-Holt and nine other students for a Computer Science Senior Capstone. I led most of the discussions and interactions with the locals and primary school students we worked with. For the Capstone, I collaborated with two students to develop a practical method for children to see and hear each other on Internet-connected tablets, while simultaneously using a custom web app. Additionally, I was entrusted to work with two students, teaching them mathematics using the Suuji App and other physical materials. Since the young students we worked with came from a background I related to, I was able to talk to Dr. Hall-Holt about some of the socio-economic issues involved with working in such communities, based on content I learned from the Ethical Issues in Software Design course by Dr. Charles Huff. </p>
                
                <h4>Summer research</h4>
                <p>The summer following my sophomore year, I participated in St. Olaf’s Collaborative Undergraduate Research and Inquiry (CURI) program under the supervision of Dr. Rodrigo Sanchez-Gonzalez in physical chemistry. In this research, I collaborated with another student to build an experimental system to measure the temperature dependence of the emission spectrum of toluene. We designed the system to capture the fluorescence of toluene vapor excited using a Nd:YAG laser. In addition, we presented our research at the CURI symposium at St. Olaf and the Midstates Consortium Research Symposium at Washington University in St. Louis. </p>
                <p>The summer following my junior year, I again took part in St. Olaf’s CURI program under the supervision of Dr. Jason Engbrecht in the physics department. In this project, I independently worked on building an experimental system for measuring Positronium-Atom collision. At the beginning of this summer research, I adapted and developed a LabVIEW program that would be used to view and analyze the real-time energy and time signals. Later on, I 3D modelled and printed the Sodium Iodide detector holders that would be mounted on the electromagnet during the collection of data. Towards the end of the summer, I engineered and programmed a Teensy-based device for monitoring the temperature of the electromagnet.</p>
                
                <h4>Academic year internship:</h4>
                <p>I participated in the St. Olaf Engineering Design Practicum course under the supervision of Dr. Jason Engbrecht. For one month of my junior year, I led a team of five undergraduates to improve the functionality of a power measuring device for Compatible Technology International (CTI). We designed an improved casing of this device using SolidWorks, and 3D printed the casing for housing a gyroscope, clock, force sensor, Bluetooth chip and Teensy microcontroller. I primarily focused on adapting and enhancing a C++ Arduino program to fix the inconsistencies with angular velocity measurements on a Teensy. Additionally, I took the lead on the incorporation of a HC-05 Bluetooth serial pass-through module, utilization of a Bluetooth Terminal app, and the implementation of a code to display the real-time measurements from our Teensy on a cell phone. We delivered an oral presentation and report to CTI at their headquarters in Minneapolis, MN, and the company will use the device to measure the power output of their grain grinding and threshing machines. Working with CTI allowed me to apply the skills I obtained from my physics and computer science courses. It was rewarding to know that our work was going to assist CTI in producing high-power output grinders and threshers that are sent to Africa to reduce poverty and hunger. During this month, I also participated in the making of the video below (Oles Explore Engineering):</p>

                <h4>Academic year research experience (Independent Research, Directed Undergraduate Research, Research project in class…):</h4>
                <p>The spring of my junior year, I participated in an independent research under the supervision of Dr. Rodrigo Sanchez-Gonzalez in physical chemistry. Independently taking over a project that had been previously conducted by a group of four seniors led by Dr. Matthew Richey in the Center for Interdisciplinary Research (CIR), I learned R to manipulate large datasets and adapted a computational method to analyze fluorescence images of Molecular Tagging Velocimetry experiments. I employed mathematical tools of image analysis involving blob detection, intersection point extraction, intersection point coupling, relative length spline mapping, vector drawing, and bilinear interpolation.</p>
                <p>Spring of my junior year, I took the Ethical Issues in Software Design course in which I was a Copernicus mobile phone consultant under the supervision of Dr. Chuck Huff. I collaborated with undergraduate team to evaluate privacy of Copernicus mobile phone application, and researched privacy literature to ensure collection and transfer of data aligned with ethical standards with regards to user privacy. Additionally, I organized a focus group with first year students to review different types of privacy statements. Moreover, I co-authored report and delivered oral presentation to Copernicus at St. Olaf College.</p>
                <p>The fall of my junior year, I carried out a Classical Mechanics research project to study the flight trajectory of a soccer ball under the supervision of Dr. Prabal Adhikari. For this project, I made a video explaining some of the important forces affecting the flight trajectory of a soccer ball. This video can be accessed on YouTube through this link:</p>

                <p>Last fall, I worked on a Materials and Nanoscience project to provide an overview focusing on the production of the wearable energy harvesting and storage devices, and the choice of materials for building these devices.</p>
